    <h2>STORY</h2>
    <article>
        <p id="spacing">I started drawing in the 2022 summer, because i wanted to have my memories last forever. Often times
            my drawings are depicting places i've been or people i hung out with.

                and i'm really happy with the result. Altough it never came to production i think i did a pretty good job, especialy 
                on the fine details of this art

                and she said that i only draw ugly stuff, and that i should try to draw some flower. So that's what i did.
